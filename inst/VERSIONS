v1.1-1--2  2017-02-10 [submitted to CRAN]
New function:
- grab.pyRAD.locus extracts a single locus

v1.0-4--1.0-6, 2014-03-18 through 2017-01-31
New features:
- multicore support in:
	* consensus.pyRAD
	* genotypes.pyRAD.loci
	* group.pyRAD.loci
	* group.subset.pyRAD.loci
	* subset.pyRAD.loci
- subset.pyRAD.loci adds snpLocs to its value, identifying locations of SNPs in the exported data
- subset.pyRAD.loci adds snpsOnly option, allowing user to just export SNP positions for loci
- write.DNAStringSet now does fasta as well as phylip
- plot.locus.dist.R now lets you set bar width and the cex for labels above the bars

New functions:
- group.pyRAD.loci to identify loci that have > n individuals of each of the groups submitted
- tidyName to clean up names for comparing names that may have messy characters added
- genotypes.pyRAD.loci to export genotype matrices to hierfstat

Bug fixes:
- subset.pyRAD.loci worked inconsistently when it was exporting SNP dataset and only one SNP was discovered; fixed
- match.lnL.to.trees previously failed to return a matrix if none of the matrix had bad (NA) columns; fixed
- NAMESPACE conflict with ape (fixed by Klaus Schliep)

Known issues:
- There is an indexing problem in hierfstat's getal function that we are getting around by sorting our group numbers in genotypes [NOT DOCUMENTED; need to notify hierfstat developers]
- genTrees is really buggy, fails often -- NOT YET FIXED

v1.0-5  31 January 2017
Fixes namespace and simplifies genTrees

v1.0-3  3 March 2014
