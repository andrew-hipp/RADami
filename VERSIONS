v1.0-4, 2014-03-18 through [2015-02-23]
New features:
- multicore support in:
	* consensus.pyRAD
	* genotypes.pyRAD.loci
	* group.pyRAD.loci
	* group.subset.pyRAD.loci
	* subset.pyRAD.loci 
- subset.pyRAD.loci adds snpLocs to its value, identifying locations of SNPs in the exported data
- subset.pyRAD.loci adds snpsOnly option, allowing user to just export SNP positions for loci
- write.DNAStringSet now does fasta as well as phylip
- plot.locus.dist.R now lets you set bar width and the cex for labels above the bars

New functions:
- LG.plot to plot loci to linkage groups, after blasting to mapped markers
- group.pyRAD.loci to identify loci that have > n individuals of each of the groups submitted [NO DOCS YET]
- tidyName to clean up names for comparing names that may have messy characters added [NO DOCS YET]
- genotypes.pyRAD.loci to export genotype matrices to hierfstat [NO DOCS YET]

Bug fixes:
- subset.pyRAD.loci worked inconsistently when it was exporting SNP dataset and only one SNP was discovered; fixed
- match.lnL.to.trees previously failed to return a matrix if none of the matrix had bad (NA) columns; fixed
- genTrees is really buggy, fails often -- NOT YET FIXED

Other notes:
- There is an indexing problem in hierfstat's getal function that we are getting around by sorting our group numbers in genotypes [NOT DOCUMENTED; need to notify hierfstat developers]
